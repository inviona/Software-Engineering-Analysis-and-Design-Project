# Current System Assessment

## Process Mapping

- **Document the current transportation processes from end to end**
- **Create flowcharts of how users currently:**

   1. Plan journeys
-User checks schedules online or at a station.
-User identifies the best route (via maps, apps, or paper schedules).
-User considers multiple transport modes if necessary.
-User estimates travel time.

   2.Purchase tickets
    -User selects a ticket type (single, round-trip, pass, etc.).
    -User purchases the ticket (cash, card, mobile app, vending machine).
    -Ticket is validated (QR code, RFID, paper ticket).
    -User keeps the ticket for boarding.
  
   3.Board vehicles
    -User arrives at the station or stop.
    -User checks real-time updates (if available).
    -Vehicle arrives, and the user validates the ticket.
    -User finds a seat or designated standing area.
  
   4.Transfer between routes/modes
    -User determines where to transfer.
    -User ensures they have the correct ticket or pass.
    -User navigates between different transport modes (bus, train, metro).
    -[User revalidates the ticket if required.
  
   5.Receive service updates
    -User receives notifications about delays, route changes, or disruptions.
    -Updates may come from apps, announcements, station displays, or staff.
    -User adjusts travel plans accordingly.

## Information Flow Analysis

- **Track how data moves through the current system**
- **Identify information bottlenecks and gaps**
- **Document where and how data is currently stored**
- **Analyze data quality issues and inconsistencies**

## Pain Point Documentation

- **Compile specific issues with the current system:**

  - Unreliable schedules
  - Difficult ticket purchasing
  - Poor route information
  - Lack of real-time updates
  - Inadequate accessibility features
